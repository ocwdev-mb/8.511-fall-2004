description: 'In this lecture the Bravais lattice is defined and several examples
  given. The basis vector is introduced for a general lattice. The theory of diffraction
  is derived, showing that Bragg refraction occurs when the momentum transfer equals
  a reciprocal vector. The reciprocal lattice is

  defined.The Ewald construction for X ?ray diffraction is explained. Emphasis is
  on the fact that the position of the diffraction spots depends only on the Bravais
  lattice. The basis only affects their intensities.'

In this lecture the Bravais lattice is defined and several examples given. The basis vector is introduced for a general lattice. The theory of diffraction is derived, showing that Bragg refraction occurs when the momentum transfer equals a reciprocal vector. The reciprocal lattice is
defined.The Ewald construction for X ?ray diffraction is explained. Emphasis is on the fact that the position of the diffraction spots depends only on the Bravais lattice. The basis only affects their intensities.
