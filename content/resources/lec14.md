The effect of a ?ux tube through the center of a ring is described. We show that a gauge
transforming which removes the ?ux tube is equivalent to a modification of the periodic
boundary condition.The Laughlin argument for the integer quantum Hall effect is given. The Halperin picture of edge states is explained in some detail,leading to an estimate that corrections to the quantization of the Hall resistance is exponentially small in the sample width.
