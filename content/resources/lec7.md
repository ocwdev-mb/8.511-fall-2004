description: The need to truncate the size of the big matrix is discussed. The problem
  is traced to the need to orthogonalize with the core state and Herring?s solution
  using orthogonalized plane wave (OW) is explained. The OPW scheme is recast as a
  pseudopotential and the nearly free electron model is justified.
