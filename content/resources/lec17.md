description: 'The Kohn ?Sham formulation of the density functional theory is explained.We
  contrast

  the Thomas ?Fermi approximation and the Kohn ?Sham treatment of the kinetic energy.
  The local density functional theory is explained as a practical method to treat
  exchange and correlation in a self-consistent band calculation. The limitations
  of the local density functional approximation is discussed, starting with the Heitler
  London approximation for hydrogen molecules. The notion of the Mott insulator is
  introduced.'
